 Wrapup of the overview

 # Concurrency and parallelism are different.
 
   ## Concurrency involves handling multiple tasks in the same time span.
   
   ## Parallelism involves processing multiple tasks literally at the same time.
      ### True parallelism requires multiple processors.
   
   ## Parallelism is a performance-boosting way to manage concurrency.

 # The classic approaches to concurrency are multiprocessing and multithreading.
 
   ## Non-blocking I/O has emerged as an option as well, but one that's typically
      used in conjunction with multiprocessing or multithreading.

   ## Non-blocking I/O sometimes is described as 'concurrency without parallelism'.

 # Different languages have different advantages when 
   it comes to studying/using
   concurrency, parallelism, and non-blocking I/O.

   ## C is close to the metal/embedded: the system libraries and 
      core OS routines at work under the hood.
   
   ## Whatever the application language, multiprocessing, 
      multithreading, and non-blocking I/O calls in the language 
      hit the C libraries and, from there, kernel-space routines.

   ## Java (C#), Go, Node.js and other languages have particular 
      styles and strength with respect to concurrency in particular.
